## Problem Statement

Grama Panchayats often delay, deny, or give vague replies to RTI applications.
There is no structured system to track RTI responses and identify evasion
patterns at the Panchayat level.

This project aims to digitally document RTI replies and assist in identifying
non-compliance patterns.
